# Implementation Handoff — How to proceed

Files generated for you:
- IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md — sequencing, phases, and definitions of done
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_CHECKLIST.md — Yes/No checklist with IDs and recommendations
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.json — machine-readable mirror (recommended defaults)

Instructions
1) Download IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_CHECKLIST.md.
2) For each item, check exactly one box (replace "[ ]" with "[x]" for Yes, or leave No as is).
3) Save and upload the edited IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_CHECKLIST.md back into the repo root.
4) Optional: If you prefer, update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.json by setting "rec" to "YES" or "NO" per item; the automation can read either file.
5) Once uploaded, tell me to “Apply the plan,” and I will execute the selected items in parallel where safe, respecting dependencies and phases.

Tips
- Start with the recommended defaults; defer large-L items if timelines are tight.
- You can run multiple rounds: foundations → core → offline/AI → estimating → collaboration/data → field/analytics → monetization.
